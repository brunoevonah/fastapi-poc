# Terraform

I'm using some terraform modules from kubernetes, but I have never used them before.<br />
Also the code here on the `terraform` folder have not been tested, just a simple `plan` have been executed.

## Partial code
The code does have some snippets to connect into an EKS cluster and also set aws access for state control, but these are all commented out.

### Simple check with
```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
```
